# CourseWeb: A Discontinued Project

Even though this project has been abandoned, you might be curious about its purpose and history.

## The Concept Behind CourseWeb
I was highly dissatisfied with my school's course search system, which relied on an outdated platform called Janzabar. It was slow, had a terrible user interface, and greatly limited the search options for courses. Users needed to know the exact course name or code, which made course discovery nearly impossible. To be more candid, I "hated" it. I usually harness "hate" and frustration to motivate change, and that's what I aimed to do with this project.

I drew inspiration from student-created tools such as [Classes.wtf](https://classes.wtf/) at Harvard and [Ten Weeks](https://tenweeks.xyz/) at Stanford, which serve as fast, natural language course search engines with clean, simple user interfaces. My goal was to create a similar platform for exploring courses at my university.

## What Went Wrong?
I developed two TypeScript scripts for the project. The first script was for scraping [all courses](data/allCourses.json) and their associated information from the school's academic bulletin, while the second script generated [topic sets](/data/courseTopicSets.json) for each course to help with search ranking calculations.

However, the academic bulletin lacked crucial information, such as course descriptions for a significant number of courses. Since course descriptions are essential for creating topic sets, this posed a major problem.

I discussed the issue with my school's CIO, who appreciated the project but could not allocate resources to share course data with me. He also mentioned that the school was already in the process of transitioning to a new system. Given that, I decided to pause the project until the following semester.

## Why is the Project "Abandoned?"
The reason is simple: I will be transferring to another university in the Fall, so it no longer makes sense for me to continue working on this project.
